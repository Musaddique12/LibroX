## 📖 About the Project

**Librox** is a smart online library system where users can rent, read, like, and buy books in PDF format. The platform is divided into three roles:

1. **User (Reader)** – can browse, rent, and interact with books and providers
2. **Admin (Book Provider)** – can upload books, track earnings, and advertise
3. **Owner (Site Admin)** – manages the overall platform, books, and inventory
